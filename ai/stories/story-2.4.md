# Story 2.4: Implement Frontend Visualization

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the visualization components for the dashboard
**so that** users can see temperature comparisons between cities.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the visualization components in the React frontend. It will create charts to display temperature curves, highlight min/max differences, and show average temperature differences. This is the final piece that brings together all the data processing and API work into a user-friendly interface.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (20 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Temperature curve visualization is implemented
2. - [ ] Min/max difference markers are displayed
3. - [ ] Average difference information is shown
4. - [ ] Loading states are handled
5. - [ ] Error states are handled
6. - [ ] Unit tests cover visualization components
7. - [ ] All tests pass with at least 80% coverage

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] Implement Chart Component
   1. - [ ] Integrate charting library
   2. - [ ] Create temperature curve visualization
   3. - [ ] Add min/max difference markers
2. - [ ] Implement Data Display
   1. - [ ] Create average difference display
   2. - [ ] Format temperature data
   3. - [ ] Add tooltips and labels
3. - [ ] Implement State Handling
   1. - [ ] Add loading states
   2. - [ ] Add error handling
   3. - [ ] Handle empty states
4. - [ ] Create Unit Tests
