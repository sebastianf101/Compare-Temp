# Story 2.4: Implement Frontend Visualization

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the visualization components for the dashboard
**so that** users can see temperature comparisons between cities.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the visualization components in the React frontend. It will create charts to display temperature curves, highlight min/max differences, and show average temperature differences. This is the final piece that brings together all the data processing and API work into a user-friendly interface.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (20 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Temperature curve visualization is implemented
2. - [x] Min/max difference markers are displayed
3. - [x] Average difference information is shown
4. - [x] Loading states are handled
