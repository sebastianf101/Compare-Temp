# Story 2.3: Implement Data Retrieval API Endpoint

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the API endpoint for retrieving temperature comparison data
**so that** the frontend can display temperature differences between cities.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the backend API endpoint that will retrieve and process temperature data for comparison. It will handle the database queries, data processing, and calculation of temperature differences. This is a critical component for providing the data needed for visualization.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (20 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] `/api/temperature-comparison` endpoint is implemented
2. - [ ] Temperature data is correctly queried from database
3. - [ ] Data is processed to calculate differences
4. - [ ] Min/max differences are calculated
5. - [ ] Average hourly differences are calculated
6. - [ ] Integration tests pass with at least 80% coverage

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] Implement Data Querying
   1. - [ ] Create database query for temperature data
   2. - [ ] Add date range filtering
   3. - [ ] Add city filtering
2. - [ ] Implement Data Processing
   1. - [ ] Align temperature data for both cities
   2. - [ ] Calculate hourly differences
   3. - [ ] Find min/max differences
3. - [ ] Implement Calculations
   1. - [ ] Calculate average hourly differences
   2. - [ ] Process 24-hour cycle data
   3. - [ ] Format response data
4. - [ ] Create Integration Tests
   1. - [ ] Test data querying
   2. - [ ] Test data processing
   3. - [ ] Test calculations
   4. - [ ] Mock database for testing

## Testing Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- All tests must pass
- Tests must cover data processing logic
- Tests must verify calculation accuracy
