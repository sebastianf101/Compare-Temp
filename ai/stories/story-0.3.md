# Story 0.3: Setup Basic CI/CD Pipeline

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to set up a basic CI/CD pipeline
**so that** we can automatically test and validate our code changes.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story establishes the continuous integration and deployment pipeline for the project. It will configure GitHub Actions (or similar) to automatically run tests and linting on code changes. This ensures code quality and catches issues early in the development process.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1 (10 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] GitHub Actions workflow is configured
2. - [x] Linting step is implemented using flake8
3. - [x] Testing step is implemented using pytest
4. - [x] Pipeline runs successfully on code changes

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Configure GitHub Actions
   1. - [x] Create workflow directory
   2. - [x] Create main workflow file
   3. - [x] Configure trigger conditions
2. - [x] Setup Linting
   1. - [x] Add flake8 to requirements.txt
   2. - [x] Create flake8 configuration file
   3. - [x] Add linting step to workflow
3. - [x] Setup Testing
   1. - [x] Configure pytest in workflow
   2. - [x] Set up test environment
   3. - [x] Add test step to workflow
4. - [x] Test Pipeline
   1. - [x] Trigger workflow manually
   2. - [x] Verify all steps pass
   3. - [x] Document pipeline usage

## Testing Requirements

- No specific code coverage requirements for this story as it's primarily configuration
- CI/CD pipeline must successfully run all configured steps

## Story Wrap Up
