# Story 1.3: Download and Process Station Metadata

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the functionality to download and process station metadata
**so that** we have accurate information about the weather stations.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the functionality to download and process station metadata from a zip file. It will handle the download of the metadata archive, extract the relevant information, and prepare it for database storage. This is essential for maintaining accurate station information in our system.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (20 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Station metadata zip file is successfully downloaded
2. - [x] Zip file is properly extracted
3. - [x] Station information is correctly parsed and structured
4. - [x] Unit tests cover metadata download, extraction, and parsing
5. - [x] All tests pass with at least 80% coverage

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Implement Download Function
   1. - [x] Create function to download zip file
   2. - [x] Add error handling for download
   3. - [x] Add logging for download status
2. - [x] Implement Zip Extraction
   1. - [x] Create function to extract zip file
   2. - [x] Add validation for zip contents
   3. - [x] Add error handling for extraction
3. - [x] Implement Metadata Parsing
   1. - [x] Create function to parse metadata file
   2. - [x] Extract station ID, name, and coordinates
   3. - [x] Add validation for metadata format
4. - [x] Create Unit Tests
   1. - [x] Test download function
   2. - [x] Test zip extraction
   3. - [x] Test metadata parsing
   4. - [x] Test with sample metadata
