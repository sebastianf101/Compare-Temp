# Story 1.2: Data Storage Implementation

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the data storage logic using the Repository pattern
**so that** we can efficiently store and retrieve temperature and station data.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the database storage logic using the Repository pattern. It will create functions to interact with the SQLite database, handle bulk data insertion, and ensure data integrity. The implementation will use standard SQL practices to maintain compatibility with future PostgreSQL migration.

## Estimation

Story Points: 3 (30 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Repository pattern is implemented for database access
2. - [x] Station metadata can be inserted/updated
3. - [x] Temperature data can be bulk inserted
4. - [x] Data integrity is maintained
5. - [x] Integration tests pass with at least 80% coverage

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Implement Repository Pattern
   1. - [x] Create base repository class
   2. - [x] Implement station repository
   3. - [x] Implement temperature repository
2. - [x] Implement Station Operations
   1. - [x] Create function to insert/update station metadata
   2. - [x] Add validation for station data
   3. - [x] Add error handling
3. - [x] Implement Temperature Operations
   1. - [x] Create function for bulk temperature data insertion
   2. - [x] Add validation for temperature data
   3. - [x] Add error handling
4. - [x] Create Integration Tests
   1. - [x] Test station operations
   2. - [x] Test temperature operations
   3. - [x] Test data integrity
   4. - [x] Test error handling

## Testing Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- All tests must pass
- Tests must cover error scenarios
- Tests must verify data integrity
