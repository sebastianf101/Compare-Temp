# Story 1.2: Extract Temperature Data

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the functionality to extract temperature data from downloaded files
**so that** we can process and store the temperature information in our database.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the data extraction functionality for the downloaded temperature files. It will parse the text files to extract relevant hourly temperature information and structure the data for storage. This is a critical step in preparing the data for database insertion.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (20 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Data extraction logic correctly parses temperature files
2. - [ ] Extracted data is properly structured (e.g., list of dicts or pandas DataFrame)
3. - [ ] All relevant temperature data points are captured
4. - [ ] Unit tests cover data extraction and parsing logic
5. - [ ] All tests pass with at least 80% coverage

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] Implement File Parsing
   1. - [ ] Create function to read text files
   2. - [ ] Implement parsing logic for temperature data
   3. - [ ] Add validation for data format
2. - [ ] Implement Data Structuring
   1. - [ ] Create data structure for temperature records
   2. - [ ] Add timestamp handling
   3. - [ ] Add temperature value validation
3. - [ ] Implement Error Handling
   1. - [ ] Handle malformed files
   2. - [ ] Handle missing data points
   3. - [ ] Add logging for parsing errors
4. - [ ] Create Unit Tests
   1. - [ ] Test file parsing
   2. - [ ] Test data structuring
   3. - [ ] Test error handling
   4. - [ ] Test with sample data files

## Testing Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- All tests must pass
- Tests must cover error scenarios
- Tests must include sample data files
