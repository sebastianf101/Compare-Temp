# Story 0.1: Setup Project Repository

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to initialize the project repository with proper structure and configuration
**so that** we have a solid foundation for the project with version control and proper organization.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This is the first story in the project and sets up the basic repository structure. It establishes the foundation for all future development work by creating the necessary directory structure, version control configuration, and initial documentation. This story is critical as it ensures all team members have a consistent starting point and understand the project organization.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1 (10 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Git repository is initialized with proper .gitignore file
2. - [ ] Initial README.md is created with project overview and setup instructions
3. - [ ] Project directory structure matches the architecture document
4. - [ ] All files are properly committed to the repository

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] Initialize Git Repository
   1. - [ ] Create .gitignore file with Python-specific patterns
   2. - [ ] Initialize git repository
   3. - [ ] Create initial commit
2. - [ ] Create Project Structure
   1. - [ ] Create data/ directory for raw data
   2. - [ ] Create db/ directory for database files
   3. - [ ] Create scripts/ directory for data processing
   4. - [ ] Create dashboard/ directory for UI code
   5. - [ ] Create tests/ directory for automated tests
3. - [ ] Create Documentation
   1. - [ ] Create initial README.md with project overview
   2. - [ ] Add setup instructions to README.md
   3. - [ ] Document directory structure in README.md

## Testing Requirements

- No specific code coverage requirements for this story as it's primarily setup and configuration
- All created files and directories must be verified to exist and be properly structured
