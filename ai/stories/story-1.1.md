# Story 1.1: Weather Service Implementation

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the weather services for different providers
**so that** we can collect temperature data from multiple sources.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the weather service interfaces and concrete implementations for different weather data providers. It will create a base interface that all weather services must implement, and then implement specific services for AEMET, OpenWeather, and SMN. This is a critical foundation for the data collection component of the application.

## Estimation

Story Points: 3 (30 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] Base weather service interface is created with required methods
2. - [x] AEMET service implementation is complete
3. - [x] OpenWeather service implementation is complete
4. - [x] SMN service implementation is complete
5. - [x] Error handling and logging are implemented
6. - [x] Unit tests cover all services with at least 80% coverage

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Create Base Interface
   1. - [x] Define abstract methods
   2. - [x] Add type hints
   3. - [x] Add documentation
2. - [x] Implement AEMET Service
   1. - [x] Create AEMETService class
   2. - [x] Implement required methods

3. - [x] Implement OpenWeather Service
   1. - [x] Create OpenWeatherService class
   2. - [x] Implement required methods
   3. - [x] Add error handling
4. - [x] Implement SMN Service
   1. - [x] Create SMNService class
   2. - [x] Implement required methods
   3. - [x] Add error handling
5. - [x] Add Error Handling
   1. - [x] Implement consistent error handling
   2. - [x] Add proper logging
   3. - [x] Handle API-specific errors
6. - [x] Create Unit Tests
   1. - [x] Test AEMET service
   2. - [x] Test OpenWeather service
   3. - [x] Test SMN service
   4. - [x] Test error handling

## Testing Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- All tests must pass
- Tests must cover error scenarios
- Tests must include mocked API responses
