# Story 1.1: Download Daily Temperature Data

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the functionality to download daily temperature data files
**so that** we can collect the historical temperature data needed for analysis.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story focuses on implementing the data download functionality for daily temperature files. It will handle the generation of URLs for the last ten years of data, manage the download process with proper error handling, and ensure data integrity. This is a critical first step in the data ingestion process.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (20 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] URL generation logic correctly creates URLs for the last ten years
2. - [ ] Download function handles network errors with retries and timeouts
3. - [ ] Missing data files are properly logged and handled
4. - [ ] Unit tests cover URL generation and download logic
5. - [ ] All tests pass with at least 80% coverage

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] Implement URL Generation
   1. - [ ] Create function to generate date range
   2. - [ ] Create function to format URLs
   3. - [ ] Add validation for URL format
2. - [ ] Implement Download Function
   1. - [ ] Create function using requests library
   2. - [ ] Add retry mechanism
   3. - [ ] Add timeout handling
   4. - [ ] Add error logging
3. - [ ] Implement Error Handling
   1. - [ ] Handle network errors
   2. - [ ] Handle missing files
   3. - [ ] Add logging for errors
4. - [ ] Create Unit Tests
   1. - [ ] Test URL generation
   2. - [ ] Test download function
   3. - [ ] Test error handling
   4. - [ ] Mock requests for testing

## Testing Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- All tests must pass
- Tests must cover error scenarios
- Tests must include mocked network requests
