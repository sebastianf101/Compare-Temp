# Story 2.1: Setup Dashboard Backend (Flask)

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to set up the Flask backend for the dashboard
**so that** we can provide API endpoints for the frontend to consume.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story focuses on setting up the Flask backend application that will serve as the API layer between the frontend and the database. It will implement the basic Flask structure and create the initial endpoint for fetching available cities. This is the foundation for the dashboard's backend functionality.

## Estimation

Story Points: 2 (20 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Basic Flask application structure is created
2. - [ ] `/api/cities` endpoint is implemented
3. - [ ] Cities are fetched from the database
4. - [ ] Unit tests cover the endpoint functionality
5. - [ ] All tests pass with at least 80% coverage
