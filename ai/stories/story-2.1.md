# Story 2.1: Setup Dashboard Backend (Flask)

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to set up the Flask backend for the dashboard
**so that** we can provide API endpoints for the frontend to consume.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on setting up the Flask backend application that will serve as the API layer between the frontend and the database. It will implement the basic Flask structure and create the initial endpoint for fetching available cities. This is the foundation for the dashboard's backend functionality.
