# Story 0.4: Initialize Database Schema

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to set up the initial database schema
**so that** we have a proper structure for storing temperature and station data.

## Status

Complete

## Context

This story focuses on creating the initial database schema for the SQLite database. The schema will be designed to store temperature data and station metadata, with a structure that's compatible with future migration to PostgreSQL. This is a critical foundation for the data storage component of the application.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1 (10 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [x] SQLite database schema is created with proper tables
2. - [x] Schema supports temperature data storage
3. - [x] Schema supports station metadata storage
4. - [x] Schema is compatible with future PostgreSQL migration
5. - [x] Database initialization script is created and tested

## Subtasks

1. - [x] Design Database Schema
   1. - [x] Create stations table schema
   2. - [x] Create temperatures table schema
   3. - [x] Define relationships between tables
2. - [x] Create Database Initialization Script
   1. - [x] Create init_db.py script
   2. - [x] Implement table creation logic
   3. - [x] Add error handling
3. - [x] Test Database Setup
   1. - [x] Test table creation
   2. - [x] Test basic queries
   3. - [x] Verify schema structure

## Testing Requirements

- No specific code coverage requirements for this story as it's primarily database setup
- Database initialization script must successfully create all required tables
- Basic CRUD operations must work on the created tables
