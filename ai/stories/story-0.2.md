# Story 0.2: Configure Docker Environment

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to set up the Docker environment for the application
**so that** we have a consistent development and deployment environment.

## Status

Draft

## Context

This story focuses on containerizing the application using Docker. It will create the necessary Docker configuration files to ensure consistent development and deployment environments. This is crucial for maintaining consistency across different development machines and preparing for future deployment scenarios.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1 (10 minutes of AI development)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. - [ ] Dockerfile is created with proper Python 3.10+ configuration
2. - [ ] docker-compose.yml is created for service orchestration
3. - [ ] requirements.txt is created with all necessary Python dependencies
4. - [ ] Docker environment can be built and run successfully

## Subtasks

1. - [ ] Create Dockerfile
   1. - [ ] Set up Python 3.10+ base image
   2. - [ ] Configure working directory
   3. - [ ] Set up environment variables
   4. - [ ] Configure entrypoint
2. - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml
   1. - [ ] Define app service
   2. - [ ] Configure volumes for data persistence
   3. - [ ] Set up environment variables
